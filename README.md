Title: "UK Road Accident Analysis Dashboard: Unveiling Trends and Factors Influencing Casualties"

Description:
Our project focuses on delving deep into the patterns and trends of road accidents across the UK, aiming to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of accidents, casualties, and various contributing factors. Utilizing the power of data analytics, particularly through pivot tables in Excel, we have developed an interactive dashboard that enables comprehensive analysis and visualization of yearly trends. By examining the relationship between the number of casualties and factors such as vehicle type, road surface conditions, and other variables, our dashboard serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders in understanding road safety dynamics and devising effective interventions.
